                There have been instances of book banning or censorship in the United States, often at the local or school district level. According to the American Library Association (ALA), the states that have reported the most challenges to books in recent years (challenges being formal complaints requesting a book to be removed from a library or school curriculum) are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Texas</li>
                <li>California</li>
                <li>Illinois</li>
                <li>Florida</li>
                <li>Missouri</li>
                <li>North Carolina</li>
                <li>Ohio</li>
                <li>Georgia</li>
                <li>Oregon</li>
                <li>Colorado</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It's worth noting that these states are not necessarily the most prevalent in terms of book banning, but they have had a relatively high number of reported challenges to books. However, the number of challenges reported may not accurately reflect the true extent of book banning or censorship in a given state, as not all incidents are formally reported to the ALA.</p>
