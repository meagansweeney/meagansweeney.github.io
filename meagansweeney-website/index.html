        <h1>United States vs Other Countries</h1>
        <p>Book banning or censorship is not prevalent in the United States in the same way that it is in some other countries. Yet, book challenges have reached an all-time high in the US - especially in more conservative states. The books targeted the most are queer and POC-centered stories aimed at teenage audiences. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech and press, which makes it difficult for the government or other entities to ban books outright.</p>
